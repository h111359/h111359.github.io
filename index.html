This is the space of Hristo M. Hristov. I am constantly adding new content here.


    <h2>So, what's this all about?</h2>
    
    My name is Hristo. This is the very very first steps in creation of my own presence in Internet.<br>
    
    For now this page will be built manually. Even more - I am doing this via the edit pane of GitHub now. But of course I will soon clone the repo locally. Soon! <br>

    <h2>Do we have same brain waves?</h2>
    
    My attention could be grabbed with topics about:
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>Python</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My art</h2>

    Will come soon.
    
    <h2>My writings</h2>
    
    Still not created.
