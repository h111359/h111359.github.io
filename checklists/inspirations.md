## We can't control everything

In ancient Greece, Stoic philosophers like Epictetus taught that we can't control everything—only our reactions. A storm may rage outside, but you decide whether it ruins your mood. This mindset helped Roman emperors, war generals, and modern leaders stay calm under pressure.

Lesson: When life throws chaos your way, pause and ask: Is this within my control? If not, let it go and focus on what you can change.


## Friluftsliv

In Norway, there’s a concept called Friluftsliv (free-loofts-liv), meaning "open-air life." It’s the belief that spending time outdoors, even in bad weather, boosts mental and physical well-being. Norwegians embrace nature daily, whether hiking, skiing, or simply walking outside.

Lesson: When overwhelmed, step outside. Fresh air, movement, and nature reset your mind and body.
