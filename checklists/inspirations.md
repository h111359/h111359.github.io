## We can't control everything

In ancient Greece, Stoic philosophers like Epictetus taught that we can't control everythingâ€”only our reactions. A storm may rage outside, but you decide whether it ruins your mood. This mindset helped Roman emperors, war generals, and modern leaders stay calm under pressure.

Lesson: When life throws chaos your way, pause and ask: Is this within my control? If not, let it go and focus on what you can change.
